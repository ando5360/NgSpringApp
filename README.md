## Andrew Assessment 
##### I apologize for the delay in delivering the Angular application. It has been some time since I last worked on a project of this nature, and I found myself restarting the work multiple times as I gradually recalled the skills I had previously acquired. This process occurred in phases, which contributed to the slower progress.

##### As a result, the application is not yet complete, and I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Additionally, I've been working diligently to reestablish my career after taking a break, which has also impacted my workflow.

##### Regarding the design, I aimed to adhere to the MVC architectural pattern. The decision to implement decentralized authentication was intentional, as I believe that, when combined with Spring's built-in libraries, it enhances the security of the application.

#####  Thank you for your time.
