# Spring Assessment | Call Center SysAdmin App
Hello my name is Andrew a hopefull candidate of BT Digital. Within this repository I have created a dynamic, easy to maintain pwa for use of administators within a intranet administration system. The application is composed of the following SDKs and build tools  Quarkus, GraalVM, Maven + Swagger / OpenApi yaml schemas + codegen. I have utilisied Java Frameworks including Spring to provide you with a good read of my skills on the subject. The use of the aformentioned technologies ensure robust testable code with high readibility in a time effcient manner.
## My Stack 
### Backend
#### Quarkus Cli
*Kubernetes Native Java Stack tailored for GraalVM, makes provisioning java code on 'the edge' a much easier task, I feel this suites the target niche as Call Centers constanstly face a flux in demand dependant on many variables such as: time of year, weather, day of the week, social-economic factors, sporting events and product recalls (Just to name a few). Provisoining on the edge will both save BT time and money.
*Streamlined Development using the Quarkus Dev Server, enabling the instant testing of code without so much as a 'save'
*Option to extend the application in future, a cli version of the web app can be very easily produced.
* Spring Compatible
#### GraalVM 22 JDK
* Native Image Functionality, which furthers scope of application for future cli deployments.
* One of the best performing JDKs on the market

### Front End
#### Angular +17
